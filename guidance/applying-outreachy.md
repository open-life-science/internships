title: Advice for contributors applying to OLS through Outreachy
---

Outreachy differs from GSoC in many aspects. Unlike GSoC, Outreachy participants can contribute in design work, documentation, community management, marketing, etc. Also, Outreachy applicants don't have to be contributors, and could be graduates, people returning to work after a break, or perhaps something else.

## Submit your initial application

The initial application includes your basic details as well as some additional information and essays. You have to answer these four essay questions -

1. Does your learning environment have few people who share your identity or background? Please provide details.
2. What systemic bias or discrimination have you faced while building your skills?
3. What systemic bias or discrimination would you face if you applied for a job in the technology industry of your country?
4. What barriers or concerns have kept you from contributing to free and open source software?

We encourage you to write your personal stories and past experiences. We want you to know that we won't judge your grammar, writing style or spelling. Please provide examples and statistics wherever you can.

All accepted applicants of this process are eligible for the Contributing period.

## Select a project and Contribute

Please note that you are required to make at least one contribution to be eligible to be selected as an intern. Applicants are also required to [record contributions](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#record-contributions) on the outreachy website. When in doubt, ask the project mentor! It's good to always ask for suggestions.

## Apply!

Please note that only applicants that record a contribution to a project will be able to submit a final application through the Outreachy website. The final application asks questions about past experience, relevant projects, proposed timeline for outreachy project.

## Application Guidelines

We expect to receive, as we did last year, lots of high quality applications. So please do give your application some thought!

* A clear understanding of the problem we need solved.
* A clear plan of action. What are you going to actually do?
* Milestones should be achievable and realistic.
* Things happen! We can’t foresee every problem! We are happy to see applications that say “I will do A and B. If there is time, I will do C.”
* Although the Outreachy application is different from GSoC, you can read the proposal from a [successful 2018 GSoC applicant](https://github.com/nupurgunwant/GSoC-Proposal), this will help you in writing your final application.
