## Select a project

Browse our [project ideas list](../../project-ideas/2022/). If you're interested in a specific project, read the project description in detail and there should be a "Get started" section that will let you know what to do next. Note that while all projects are affiliated with Open Life Science (OLS), OLS is an umbrella organisation, meaning that mentors from one project might not be familiar with other project details. 

## Apply!

- We have an [OLS proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvZG5SDqdvSTBxLrVy0JbVbs0A42rHToJwxHd89Hftc/edit) that we recommend you use.
- Your project description should have clear guidelines to help you write a successful proposal.

## Proposal Guidelines

We expect to receive, as we did last year, lots of high quality applications. So please do give your application some thought!

* A clear understanding of the problem we need solved.
* A clear plan of action. What are you going to actually do?
* Milestones should be achievable and realistic.
* Things happen! We can’t foresee every problem! We are happy to see proposals that say “I will do A and B. If there is time, I will do C.”
* Read the proposal from a [successful 2018 applicant](https://github.com/nupurgunwant/GSoC-Proposal) to get an idea of what a good proposal might look like.

We are happy to read your proposal and give you feedback. Please allow for a few days for us to get back to you -- don’t wait until the last minute!
