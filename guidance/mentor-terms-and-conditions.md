OLS Obligations
=====================

OLS will support all mentors throughout their mentorship period,
providing both guidance and technical support.


Mentor Obligations
==================

During the application period
-----------------------------

-   Mentors will communicate with applicants and help them create
    relevant proposals.
-   CC any co-mentors when responding to communication from contributors via
    email.

During contributor selection
-------------------------

-   Mentors will discuss with their co-mentor to identify promising
    contributors.
-   Be aware that there are often more good contributors than there are
    slots the organisation can support. This means we may not be able
    to take on your favourite contributor.

During the community bonding and coding phases
----------------------------------------------

Mentors should:

-   Make sure they speak to their contributor at least **weekly**.
-   Inform the organisation administrators if any issues arise, or seem
    likely to arise, including:
    -   Mentor is unable to continue mentoring or experiencing too high
        workload.
    -   contributor is under performing or non responsive.
-   Complete all evaluations as early as possible in agreement with
    their co-mentor and encourage contributors to complete them early as
    well.
    -   Please see [*Google guidance*](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/evaluations) on poor performing contributors.
-   Coordinate vacation and out-of-office periods to ensure at least one
     mentor is available to respond to their contributor at all times. If
     both mentors are likely to be unavailable at the same time, please
     speak to an organisation administrator to arrange backup. This is
     particularly important around evaluation periods!

GSoC Funds
==========

What OLS receives
------------------------

Assuming the payment terms are the same as
[*previous years*](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/org-payments),
Google pays OLS \$500 USD per accepted contributor. These
funds are disbursed after the project is completed, so September or
October, after which OLS takes time to process them.

What OLS will spend the money on
--------------------------------------

### Contributor & Mentor Gifts

OLS will send gifts to all OLS mentors and GSoC contributors who
pass their evaluations. It is also possible a small amount of this
funding will be allocated to contributors who were not accepted as
GSoC contributors but worked for OLS anyway. This yearâ€™s gifts will be decided upon as a group amongst the mentors and as such the nature and ultimate cost of
this expense may change.

### Mentor Summit Places

If the mentor summit is in-person, at least one mentor summit place will be reserved for an org admin. Other mentors are welcome to apply as well.

### Mentor Stipends

After the funds have been disbursed as detailed above, remaining funds
will be distributed evenly amongst all mentors who mentored at least one
contributor.

**Please note these terms are subject to change without notice at the
discretion of the OLS team.**

What to do if there is a problem
================================

Please contact an organisation administrator. In the first instance,
this is Yo Yehudi - [*yo@openlifesci.org*](mailto:yo@openlifesci.org). If
Yo is non-responsive, or your issue is with Yo, please speak to [ADD SECOND CONTACT]
