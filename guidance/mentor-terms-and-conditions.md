OLS Obligations
=====================

OLS will support all mentors throughout their mentorship period,
providing both guidance and technical support.

All non-Cambridge based mentors will be matched with a mentor from the
OLS core team for support and backup.

Mentor Obligations
==================

During the application period
-----------------------------

-   Mentors will communicate with applicants and help them create
    relevant proposals.

-   CC any co-mentors when responding to communication from students via
    email.

During student selection
-------------------------

-   Mentors will discuss with their co-mentor to identify promising
    students.

-   Be aware that there are often more good students than there are
    slots the organisation can support. This means we may not be able
    to take on your favourite student.

During the community bonding and coding phases
----------------------------------------------

Mentors should:

-   Make sure they speak to their student at least weekly.

-   Inform the organisation administrators if any issues arise, or seem
    likely to arise, including:

    -   Mentor is unable to continue mentoring or experiencing too high
        workload.

    -   Student is under performing or non responsive.

-   Complete all evaluations as early as possible in agreement with
    their co-mentor and encourage students to complete them early as
    well.

    -   Please see [*Google guidance*](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/evaluations) on poor performing students.

-   Coordinate vacation and out-of-office periods to ensure at least one
     mentor is available to respond to their student at all times. If
     both mentors are likely to be unavailable at the same time, please
     speak to an organisation administrator to arrange backup. This is
     particularly important around evaluation periods!

GSoC Funds
==========

What OLS receives
------------------------

Assuming the payment terms are the same as
[*2017*](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/org-payments),
Google pays OLS \$500 USD per accepted student, \$2,200 to send
two mentors for organisation admins to the Mentor Summit (assuming no
evaluations are missed by mentors or students), and another \$500 to
send a student or mentor to a relevant conference or meeting. These
funds are disbursed after the project is completed, so September or
October, after which the University takes time to process them.

What OLS will spend the money on
--------------------------------------

### Conferences

The OLS Cambridge team will decide how to allocate these funds.

### Student & Mentor Gifts

OLS will send gifts to all OLS mentors and GSoC students who
pass their evaluations. It is also possible a small amount of this
funding will be allocated to summer students who were not accepted as
GSoC students but worked for OLS anyway. In 2017, this came out at
around £276.48 for gifts, plus postage to those students and mentors who
were not based in the UK. This year’s gifts will be decided upon as a
group amongst the mentors and as such the nature and ultimate cost of
this expense may change.

### Mentor Summit Places

At least one mentor summit place will be reserved for a core OLS
member. Other mentors are welcome to apply as well.

### Mentor Stipends

After the funds have been disbursed as detailed above, remaining funds
will be distributed evenly amongst all mentors who mentored at least one
student.

**Please note these terms are subject to change without notice at the
discretion of the OLS team.**

What to do if there is a problem
================================

Please contact an organisation administrator. In the first instance,
this is Yo Yehudi - [*yo@OLS.org*](mailto:yo@OLS.org). If
she’s non-responsive, or your issue is with her, please speak to Daniela Butano - [*daniela@OLS.org*](mailto:daniela@OLS.org)
