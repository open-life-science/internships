Please see the [Guidance for accepted contributors](contributors-accepted.md) for general contributor expectations. 

Also read (or at least skim!) the [Google Manual](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) for mentors. It's actually very useful.

Finally, we have the [GSoC Mentor Terms and Conditions](mentor-terms-and-conditions.md), where we try to set out openly what both what we expect from mentors and how we spend the money Google pays OLS. We've done our best to be clear and correct, but things may change. Please be aware the terms and conditions are _not_ a contract.
