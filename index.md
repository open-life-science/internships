Welcome to the Open Life Science (OLS) internships homepage! We're excited that you're interested in an internship with OLS!

## About OLS

OLS is a mentoring & training program for Open Science ambassadors. You can read more about the OLS community on the [OLS Website](https://openlifesci.org/)

For GSoC, OLS functions as an umbrella organisation for community members who have open source code projects.

## Get started

Review the application advice for students section, which has details on how to apply for [GSoC](guidance/students-applying-gsoc/) and [Outreachy](guidance/students-applying-outreachy/) with OLS.

## Contribute to OLS! (outside of GSoC and Outreachy)

For GSoC applications, your proposal is more important than making PRs or prototypes. However - if you'd like to start contributing to OLS, you're welcome to do this anytime, not just GSoC and Outreachy!
