title: GSoC Cohort Calls
---

In order to give contributors a good sense of community, and to help them learn about the software they'll be working on, we run several full-group calls throughout GSoC. We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for this, primarily because it allows us to break up community calls into smaller breakout groups for discussions.

## Application period: GSoC webinar

During the application period, we usually run a recorded call for all interested attendees. This covers the following topics:  
- testimonials and application from contributors in previous years
- mentors discussing the goals of each project and answer any applicant questions

## Accepted contributor projects

Accepted contributors are invited to participate in the following calls:  

### Month one: **GSoC kick-off** 
 **Who attends:** contributors, as many mentors as possible  
 **Call template:** [GitHub](kick-off-call) [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/Hk3wd-ZPr)
  - Tell the contributors about 
    - the org and general roadmap
    - working policies for the next few months
  - contributors introduce themselves and their project plans
  - group activity: contributors discuss good and bad things they've encountered in open source and/or software development. This aims to get contributors thinking about good practices for their own repos. 

### Month two: **Coding good practices, providing feedback, and code review** 

 **Who attends:**  contributors, mentors optional but welcome    
 **Call template:** [GitHub](code-review) [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/BJ8cvpvwS)  
 
  - Group discussion: What makes code good? What makes it awful? 
  - Break-out room: contributors begin by reviewing code of _others_ (i.e. repos that don't belong to the org) in groups of 2-3.
  - Giving feedback: As a group we discuss the importance of giving both positive and negative feedback, and how to do so effectively and compassionately. 
  - Break-out room: In groups of 2-3, contributors bring one of their own repos that they've been working on, and provide each other with feedback. 

### Month three: **Practice for final presentations**  

**Who attends:**  Mentors aren't invited to this call, just to give contributors a safe space to practice with the team.  
**Call template:**  [GitHub](final-presentation-practice) [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/r1D4lxtPBv)  

  - contributors are reminded of the feedback exerise we did last call
  - contributors present for five minutes, practicing what they'll share with the whole OLS community at the end of the month
    - Each other contributor provides one bit of positive feedback and one suggestion to improve for each talk. 
    
### Final Evaluation Period: **Final presentations**

**Who attends:** All the OLS community is invited.  
**Call template:**  [GitHub](final-presentations) [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/SkNXYlYvB)  

  - contributors present their refined presentations, with a strict 5-minute time limit.
